# C-data-structures
This is a repository containing declarations and definitions of different data structures in C. Multiple definitions are proposed for each data structure, such as alternatives using arrays and/or linked lists. It is designed for learning, practice, and use in larger projects. Each data structure is implemented with comments and example usage.
